# Strategy Pattern

"The Strategy pattern does have one thing in common with the Template Method
pattern: Both patterns allow us to concentrate the decision about which variation we
are using in one or a few places. With the Template Method pattern, we make our
decision when we pick our concrete subclass. In the Strategy pattern, we make our
decision by selecting a strategy class at runtime."
