# Design Patterns in Ruby

A collection of 10 of the GoF Design Patterns explained by examples found on different libraries and projects.

These examples are meant to be representative of things that can be applied in the design of Ruby on Rails applications.

## What is a design pattern?

*Is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. A design pattern is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.*

*A pattern must explain why a particular situation causes problems, and why the proposed solution is considered a good one.*

## A collection of patterns forms a pattern language

*A pattern language, a term coined by architect Christopher Alexander, is a structured method of describing good design practices within a field of expertise. Advocates of this design approach claim that ordinary people of ordinary intelligence can use it to successfully solve very large, complex design problems.*
