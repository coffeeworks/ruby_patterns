# Template Method Pattern
*A template method defines the program skeleton of an algorithm. One or more of the algorithm 
steps can be overridden by subclasses to allow differing behaviors while ensuring that the 
overarching algorithm is still followed.*

The base class may:

- Define abstract methods

- Provide default implementations

- Define empty methods (hooks)
