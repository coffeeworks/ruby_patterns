# Thoughts

## Where can I put all these classes in a Rails app?

You can create your own folders like:

- app/services
- app/commands
- app/models/presenters
- app/models/observers
- app/models/searchers

You can break the 1 class 1 file convention for really small classes.

You can pack them in a Gem.
